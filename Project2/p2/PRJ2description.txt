Program launches two threads, one for mother and one for father. There are twelve children that the threads must modify. The mother wakes up and performs her tasks on the children and locks them with a mutex. When the children are given a bath, they are unlocked to be read a book and put to bed by the father thread. Input takes an int that will define how many cycles the program will run.
